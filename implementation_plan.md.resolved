# UI Improvement and Animation Plan

## Goal
Revamp the landing page ([src/app/page.tsx](file:///Users/arogyabichpuria/Documents/side-quests/deepsearch/src/app/page.tsx)) to have a premium, modern feel with interactive and scroll animations.

## User Review Required
- [ ] **Design Direction**: Moving towards a "Deep Search" aesthetic with rich gradients, glassmorphism, and smooth motion.
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Adding `framer-motion` for animations.

## Proposed Changes

### Dependencies
- Install `framer-motion`

### [src/app/page.tsx](file:///Users/arogyabichpuria/Documents/side-quests/deepsearch/src/app/page.tsx)
- **Hero Section**:
    - Implement a staggered text reveal animation for the headline.
    - Add a "breathing" or floating background effect (e.g., moving gradient orbs).
    - Animate the CTA buttons on load.
- **Interactive Elements**:
    - Add a "Search Simulation" component in the hero area that demonstrates the tool's capability (typing effect + result card appearance).
- **Features Section**:
    - Use `motion.div` for scroll-triggered fade-in and slide-up effects for feature cards.
    - Add hover effects (scale up, glow) to feature cards.
- **Visuals**:
    - Enhance typography (Inter/Geist is likely already used).
    - Use a refined color palette (Deep Purples, Slate, Electric Blue).
    - Add glassmorphism effects to cards.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run build` to ensure no build errors.

### Manual Verification
- Verify animations work smoothly on load and scroll.
- Check responsiveness on mobile and desktop.
- Ensure Clerk authentication buttons (`SignedOut`, `SignedIn`) still function correctly.
